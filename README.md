# What is makemore

Character level language-model. It takes a text file as input (training data), where each line represents a training word. Based on it's training data it will generate more words that are similar.

Architecture we will cover:
 - bigram
 - bag of words
 - MLP
 - RNN
 - Transformers

Majority of the work/code done here is me following Andrej Karpathy's series of lectures on Neural Networks on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6sfmUTpUmc&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=5)
